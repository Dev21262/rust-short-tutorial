Runtime Errors
✅ Happens while the program is running (after compiling).
✅ Crashes the program unexpectedly if not handled.
✅ Caused by:

Dividing by zero
Accessing out-of-bounds array indexes
Integer overflow in debug mode
Trying to unwrap a None value


Compile-Time Errors
✅ Happens while compiling the code (before execution).
✅ Prevents the program from running until fixed.
✅ Caused by:

Syntax errors (wrong Rust syntax)
Type errors (mismatched data types)
Missing variables or functions

Panic in Rust is a runtime error that causes the program to immediately terminate and 
unwind the call stack unless explicitly handled.
