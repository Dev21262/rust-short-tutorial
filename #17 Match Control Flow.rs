//In order to perform expressions that the type of a variant allow. We must write code for each type of variant
//This is done using Match It is a powerful Control Flow Statement

//match itself is an expression, meaning it produces a value.
//  You can assign the result of a match to a variable.

//Match checks for the variant of Coin and then returns a value. For penny it is 1
//Inside the match there are arms. An arm has two parts pattern and some code. Use Curly brackets if there is a lot of code
//The code can return a value and also contain some statements


// When the match expression executes, it compares the resultant value against the pattern of each arm, in order. If a
// pattern matches the value, the code associated with that pattern is executed. If that pattern doesnâ€™t match the value,
// execution continues to the next arm

//Note Match is not limited to only enums. Match can also be used
//With Integers, Tuples, Structs etc

// 2 | 3 is an or operation
// _ handles all the other case. Note we must handle all cases while using the match statement.
//Exhaustive checking in Rust means the compiler forces you to cover every possible case 
// Sometimes for most of the cases you want a default action you can use the keyword 'other' or '_' for that
