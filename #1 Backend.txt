#Backend
    In web development, the backend refers to the server-side of a website or
    web application. It is responsible for handling data, processing requests,
    and ensuring the functionality of the application. Unlike the frontend, 
    which deals with the user interface, the backend works behind the scenes
    to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.

#Servers
    A server is a computer or software that provides services, data, or 
    resources to other computers, known as clients, over a network. Servers
    handle requests from clients and respond with the necessary information or
    actions. They are a fundamental part of the internet and web development.

Web Server – Hosts websites and serves web pages to users. Example: Apache, Nginx.
Database Server – Stores and manages databases. Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL.

APIs are the bridge between front end and backend. They are the rules 
and protocols which followed will allow one to interact with the backend.
APIs are not just limited to frontend-backend communication; they can also
enable backend-to-backend interactions, like microservices communicating
with each other.
