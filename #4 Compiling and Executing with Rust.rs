fn main() { 
    //the function that runs first is the main function - a special func 
    // in rust

    println!("Hi, I am 21262!"); 
    // The ! means you are using a macro instead of a normal function
}

/*rustc means compiling a rust program for eg - 'rustc first.rs' will 
compile the rust file named first*/
//After compiling a .pdb file will appear which contains debugging information
/*Program is run after compiling using the format .\path for eg -
.\first.exe. Note exe is used instead of rs when running */


//If youâ€™re more familiar with a dynamic language, such as Ruby, Python,
//  or JavaScript, you might not be used to compiling and running a program
//  as separate steps. Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, meaning
//  you can compile a program and give the executable to someone else, and
//  they can run it even without having Rust installed. If you give someone
//  a .rb, .py, or .js file, they need to have a Ruby, Python, or JavaScrip
// t implementation installed (respectively). But in those languages, you 
// only need one command to compile and run your program. Everything is a 
// trade-off in language design.
